// LookupResult communicates the outcome of an on-chain verification call.

// The asymmetry between LookupAmbiguous and LookupNotFound is critical to the
// safety invariant: an RPC error or unknown response is NOT evidence of
// absence. Treating it as such caused the class of bugs in MR review — a
// transient RPC failure during the mimir-gated bypass produced duplicate
// broadcasts whenever the original was actually live.

	// LookupAmbiguous indicates the verification call could not positively
	// confirm presence or absence (RPC error, unparsable response, empty

// SignTxCacheCheck implements the standard signer-cache check performed at the
// top of a chain client's SignTx. It mirrors the Solana reference pattern
// (sol_client.go) so all chain clients enforce the same safety invariant by
// construction:
//
//  1. If no cache entry exists -> proceed with signing.
//  2. If the cache entry is fresh -> skip signing.
//  3. If the cache entry has expired:
//     a. If gateFn is nil or returns false -> skip signing (respect cache).
//     b. If no recorded broadcast hash -> skip signing (cannot verify).
//     c. Otherwise call verifyFn on the recorded sig:
//     - LookupFound or LookupAmbiguous -> skip signing.
//     - LookupNotFound -> clear the cache and proceed with re-signing.
//
// The gateFn parameter is the operational guard for the verification path. It
// is invoked lazily — only when the cache is expired AND the gate decision is
// actually needed. Solana passes a closure that always returns true (no
// mimir gate). The other chain clients pass a closure that reads
// SkipSignerCache<Chain> mimir, so operators retain a kill-switch over the
// recovery path. Lazy evaluation avoids an HTTP round-trip on every SignTx
// call when the cache is fresh or absent.
