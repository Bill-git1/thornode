# ADR 27: Affiliate Revenue Share (REVSHARE)

## Changelog

- 2026-04-20: Design approved.
- 2026-04-27: ADR drafted.

## Status

Proposed

## Context

THORChain's existing affiliate system takes a cut of the **user's input
amount** at swap time via the memo `affiliate` / `affiliate_bps` fields.
There is no mechanism to share the **protocol's own income** (the RUNE
liquidity fees collected on swaps) with the affiliate that drove the
swap. This limits the business models affiliates can build on top of
THORChain — they can only earn by taxing their users more heavily,
even when they are demonstrably driving the protocol's swap revenue.

ADR 16 went the other direction: it added `ProtocolAffiliateFeeBasisPoints`
so the protocol could take a cut of the affiliate's fee. This ADR is the
complementary lever: the protocol gives back a configurable share of the
liquidity fees it earned from swaps an affiliate routed.

The dial must be:

- Per-thorname (different affiliates earn different shares).
- Operationally controlled (low-quorum mimir, churned out like other
  operational keys), so node operators can iterate without an upgrade.
- Capped (the protocol cannot give away more than half its own income on
  a per-affiliate basis under any setting).
- Paid out of protocol income, not user funds, so the user-side affiliate
  cut continues to behave exactly as it does today.

## Alternative Approaches

1. **Direct reserve → external address transfer per swap.** Rejected:
   bypasses `AffiliateCollector`, breaks preferred-asset conversion,
   and pays out at swap-record time rather than block-end (worse for
   accounting and event ordering).
2. **Single global REVSHARE bps for all affiliates.** Rejected: cannot
   express different commercial relationships, and a single dial is the
   wrong abstraction for what is fundamentally a per-affiliate setting.
3. **Pay out of `totalLiquidityFees` directly (mint / divert before
   reserve roll-up).** Rejected: existing accounting funnels all
   liquidity fees through the reserve as `systemIncome`. Diverting
   pre-roll-up complicates invariants; deducting "off the top" of
   `systemIncome` after roll-up keeps the reserve balanced and reuses
   the existing module-to-module transfer surface.
4. **Apply REVSHARE to add/withdraw, savers, lending, trade accounts,
   secured assets, and rune pool fees.** Rejected for v1: the goal is
   to share _swap_ fee revenue with the affiliate that brought the
   swap. Other surfaces have different fee semantics and can be added
   later without re-doing this design.
5. **Fall through the affiliate list (if A has no REVSHARE, try B).**
   Rejected: encourages spam-filling the affiliate list to harvest
   revenue, and conflicts with the intent that a swap has exactly one
   affiliate-of-record.

## Decision

Add a per-thorname revenue-share mechanism gated by an operational
mimir `REVSHARE-<thorname>` (basis points, capped at 5000). When set,
the protocol pays the named thorname `bps × attributed_liquidity_fee /
10_000` from the reserve to `AffiliateCollector` at end of block, and
reduces `systemIncome` by that total before any other split runs (dev
fund, burn, TCY, marketing, POL, bond/LP pendulum). Attribution is
strict-first-memo-affiliate, accumulates across streaming sub-swaps,
and resolves only to active thornames; raw addresses and expired
thornames are ignored.

A `rev_share` event is emitted at end of block for every thorname with
non-zero per-block accrual — including when REVSHARE is unset (bps=0,
payout=0) — so off-chain indexers can track gross attribution
independently of payout configuration.

## Detailed Design

The full design lives at
[`docs/superpowers/specs/2026-04-20-affiliate-revshare-design.md`](../superpowers/specs/2026-04-20-affiliate-revshare-design.md).
Summary follows.

### Constants

- `constants.RevShareMaxBps = 5000` — hard cap (50%) per thorname.
- `constants.MimirTemplateRevShareThorName = "REVSHARE-%s"`.

### Keeper state

New keyspace `AffiliateLiquidityFee/<thorname> → sdk.Uint` (RUNE, 1e8).
Per-block accumulator only; cleared at end of block after payouts.
Distinct from `AffiliateCollector` (which holds paid-out, cross-block
balances awaiting preferred-asset conversion).

```go
AddAffiliateLiquidityFee(ctx, thorname, fee) error
GetAffiliateLiquidityFees(ctx) []AffiliateLiquidityFee
DeleteAffiliateLiquidityFees(ctx)
```

`GetAffiliateLiquidityFees` returns a slice of `(Thorname, Fee)` entries
sorted lexicographically by upper-cased `Thorname`. The lex order is
consensus-critical: end-of-block deduction iterates the slice and emits
events in slice order, so any non-deterministic order across nodes
would diverge state. The slice form (rather than `map[string]Uint` +
iterator) was chosen so the determinism contract is in the type itself
and callers cannot accidentally introduce `for ... range map`
iteration.

The function returns no `error`. Per-entry decode failures are logged
and skipped inside the iteration: end-of-block drain unconditionally
deletes the accumulator, so an aborted iteration would silently
discard every sibling entry's attribution for the block. Skip-and-
continue limits the blast radius to the single corrupted entry, and
removes the only failure mode the function could surface; bubbling an
error to `processRevShare` would be dead code.

Files: `x/thorchain/keeper/v1/keeper_affiliate_liquidity_fee.go` and
keeper interface addition in `x/thorchain/keeper/keeper.go`
(`AffiliateLiquidityFee` struct + `KeeperAffiliateLiquidityFees`
interface).

### Swap-path attribution

In `Swapper.Swap`, immediately after `AddToLiquidityFees`, attribute
the same fee to the swap memo's first affiliate when it resolves to an
active thorname (`ExpireBlockHeight > ctx.BlockHeight()`). Strict
first-affiliate, no fall-through. Applies to every fee-recording path
including streaming sub-swap iterations (the swap handler re-parses
the parent memo each tick, so each sub-swap reuses the parent's first
affiliate).

The REVSHARE mimir is **not** read at attribution time; that lookup
happens at payout, so attribution is resilient to operators
enabling/disabling REVSHARE mid-block.

### End-of-block deduction (`UpdateNetwork`)

In `x/thorchain/manager_network_current.go`, immediately after
`systemIncome := blockReward.Add(totalLiquidityFees)` and **before**
any other split:

1. Iterate the slice returned by
   `keeper.GetAffiliateLiquidityFees(ctx)` (lex-ordered by Thorname).
   For each entry:
   - Look up the thorname owner. If the thorname no longer exists,
     emit a `rev_share` event with empty owner and `payout = 0` (the
     event is the canonical record of attribution; payout is skipped
     and RUNE remains in the reserve).
   - Read `bps = mimir("REVSHARE-" + thorname)`. The
     `GetMimirWithRef` "unset" sentinel (`-1`) is normalised to `0` by
     the `NewEventRevShare` constructor so indexers never see a
     negative `bps` attribute.
   - If `bps > 0`: `payout = bps × accrued / 10_000`, transfer from
     reserve to `AffiliateCollector` for the thorname owner, and
     accumulate into `totalRevShare`.
   - Always emit a `rev_share` event with `(thorname, owner, accrued,
bps, payout)`, even when `bps == 0` or the thorname is missing.
2. `keeper.DeleteAffiliateLiquidityFees(ctx)`.
3. `systemIncome = SafeSub(systemIncome, totalRevShare)`.
4. Existing splits run unchanged off the reduced `systemIncome`.

**Bookkeeping invariant.** The reserve has just received
`totalLiquidityFees` as part of the system-income roll-up. Rev-share
moves a subset of that out to `AffiliateCollector`; no RUNE is minted.
`Σ payouts ≤ 0.5 × Σ accrued ≤ 0.5 × totalLiquidityFees`, so
`systemIncome` cannot go negative.

### Mimir: validation and operational classification

Set-time validation (in the mimir handler and node-mimir vote
validation) rejects `REVSHARE-<X>` when `<X>` is not an existing
thorname or the value is outside `[0, 5000]`.

`REVSHARE` is added to `IsOperationalMimir`'s prefix list so the key
is clearable via operational vote and is purged from node-mimir votes
at end-of-block by `PurgeOperationalNodeMimirs`, matching the
HALT/PAUSE/etc. pattern.

**THORName character-set limitation.** `IsValidTHORName` accepts
`[a-zA-Z0-9+_-]`, but `MimirKeyRegex` (which gates every mimir key set)
accepts only `[a-zA-Z0-9-]`. The intersection is the only set of names
for which `REVSHARE-<thorname>` can be set: a thorname containing `_`
or `+` registers cleanly but its operator can never enable REVSHARE
because the targeted mimir key fails `mimirValidKey` validation.
Operators who want REVSHARE eligibility must register a thorname using
only letters, digits, and `-`.

### Event

```text
type: rev_share
attributes:
  thorname:    <name>
  owner:       <thor1...>
  accrued_fee: <RUNE liquidity fee attributed this block, 1e8>
  bps:         <REVSHARE mimir value applied; 0 if unset>
  payout:      <RUNE moved reserve → AffiliateCollector, 1e8; 0 if no payout>
```

Emitted for every accumulator entry, including `bps == 0 && payout ==
0`, so indexers can answer "gross liquidity fees attributable to
affiliate X" independently of REVSHARE configuration.

### Testing

- Unit tests for the keeper (round-trip), swap-path attribution
  (strict first affiliate, raw address skip, expired thorname skip,
  streaming roll-up), `UpdateNetwork` (systemIncome reduction, reserve
  → AffiliateCollector delta, missing-thorname skip, event shape), and
  mimir validation (cap, negative, unknown thorname).
- Regression suite `test/regression/suites/affiliate-revshare.yaml`:
  registers a thorname, sets REVSHARE, performs a swap with that
  thorname as first memo affiliate, asserts the `rev_share` event,
  the affiliate-collector balance delta, and the reserve balance
  reduction relative to baseline.

### Version gating

Both `UpdateNetwork` deduction and swap-handler attribution sit behind
a version bump via the standard `GetVersion` switch. Mimir validation
is additive and ships immediately. No state migration — the
accumulator starts empty each block.

## Consequences

### Positive

- Affiliates can earn a residual share of the protocol revenue they
  drive without raising user-side fees.
- Per-thorname dial enables differentiated commercial relationships.
- Off-chain indexers (Midgard, etc.) get a single `rev_share` event
  that captures both gross attribution and net payouts in one feed.
- No new module accounts, no migration, low blast radius.

### Negative

- Reduces the share of swap fees flowing into existing splits (dev
  fund, burn, TCY stake, marketing, POL, bond/LP pendulum) by exactly
  `Σ payouts` per block. Operationally controlled but worth
  monitoring.
- One additional iterator pass and N module-to-module transfers per
  block (one per thorname with attributed fees). Bounded by the number
  of distinct first-affiliates seen per block; expected to be small.
- An additional event emitted per thorname per block — minor indexer
  work. Volume is bounded by the count of distinct first-affiliates
  with non-zero accrual in the block (O(10s) in practice). The
  emission is unconditional (it fires even when bps=0 or the payout
  rounds to zero, so indexers never undercount); the bound is set by
  organic swap volume rather than by REVSHARE configuration, since
  the accumulator is populated by the swap path regardless of mimir
  state. A future revision could suppress the bps=0/payout=0 event
  after a grace period if the indexer cost proves material.

### Neutral

- The user-side affiliate cut path (`skimAffiliateFees`) is untouched.
- Add/withdraw, savers, lending, trade accounts, secured assets, and
  rune pool fees remain out of scope for v1.
