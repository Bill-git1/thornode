// ChainHeight pairs a chain with a block height.

// Keeper methods returning []ChainHeight always return it in ascending chain
// order. That ordering is inherent rather than imposed: each chain is stored
// under its own key suffixed with the chain name, and prefix iteration walks
// keys in ascending byte order, which for uppercase chain names is the same as
// sorting them. Callers therefore never need to sort, and — more importantly —
// cannot forget to.
